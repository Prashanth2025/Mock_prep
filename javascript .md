JavaScript

JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming language used for client-side scripting on the web. It's a versatile language used for creating interactive web pages, web applications, and mobile applications.

Function Call

A function call is an expression that invokes a function. When a function is called, the code inside the function is executed, and the function returns a value.

Method Call

A method call is an expression that invokes a method on an object. Methods are functions that are properties of an object.

Identifiers, Rules

Identifiers are names given to variables, functions, and labels in JavaScript. Rules:
* Must start with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign.
* Can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
* Cannot be a reserved keyword.

Variables

Variables are used to store and manipulate data. In JavaScript, variables can be declared using var, let, or const.

Why JS is Dynamic-Type Program Lang

JavaScript is dynamically typed because it does not require explicit type definitions for variables. The data type of a variable is determined at runtime.

Redeclaration, Rules

Redeclaration occurs when a variable is declared multiple times in the same scope. Rules:
* var allows redeclaration.
* let and const do not allow redeclaration.

Reinitialization, Rules

Reinitialization occurs when a variable's value is changed after it's declared. Rules:
* var, let, and const allow reinitialization, but const requires a value when declared.

Strict Mode

Strict mode is a way to opt-in to a restricted variant of JavaScript that provides more informative error messages and prevents certain types of errors.

Datatypes, Types of Datatypes

JavaScript has several datatypes:
* Primitive types: number, string, boolean, null, undefined, symbol.
* Reference types: object, array, function.

Type Conversion

Type conversion is the process of converting a value from one type to another.

Type Coercion

Type coercion is the automatic conversion of a value from one type to another.

Operators, Types

Operators are symbols used to perform operations on values. Types:
* Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, etc.)
* Comparison operators (==, !=, ===, !==, etc.)
* Logical operators (&&, ||, !)
* Assignment operators (=, +=, -=, etc.)

Operations Performed Using +

The + operator can perform addition, concatenation, or both.

Template String

Template strings are a way to create strings using backticks and ${} syntax.

Prompt

prompt is a function that displays a dialog box and returns the user's input.

Truthy and Falsy Values

Truthy values are values that evaluate to true in a conditional statement. Falsy values are values that evaluate to false.

Postfix / Prefix

Postfix and prefix operators are used to increment or decrement a value.

Short Circuit Evaluation

Short circuit evaluation is a behavior where the second operand of a logical operator is not evaluated if the first operand determines the result.

Conditional Statement

Conditional statements are used to execute different blocks of code based on conditions.

Looping Statements

Looping statements are used to execute a block of code repeatedly.

Break

break is a statement that exits a loop or switch statement.

Continue

continue is a statement that skips to the next iteration of a loop.

Return

return is a statement that exits a function and returns a value.

Functions, Types of Function

Functions are blocks of code that can be executed multiple times. Types:
* Function declaration
* Function expression
* Arrow function

IIFE

IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a function that is executed immediately after it's defined.

Unreachable Statement

An unreachable statement is a statement that cannot be executed.

Function with Parameters, Types

Functions can take parameters, which are values passed to the function when it's called.

Higher Order Function

A higher-order function is a function that takes another function as an argument or returns a function.

Callback Function

A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function.

JS Runtime Environment

The JavaScript runtime environment is the environment in which JavaScript code is executed.

Object

An object is a collection of key-value pairs.

Two Ways to Create Object

Objects can be created using the Object constructor or the object literal syntax.

Bracket Notation

Bracket notation is a way to access properties of an object using square brackets.

Dot Notation

Dot notation is a way to access properties of an object using a dot.

Call Stack

The call stack is a data structure that keeps track of the functions that are currently being executed.

Global Execution Context

The global execution context is the top-level execution context in JavaScript.

Variable Object

A variable object is an object that stores the variables declared in a scope.

Array

An array is a collection of values of the same type.

JIT

JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation is a technique used by JavaScript engines to improve performance.

Lexical Environment

The lexical environment is the scope in which a function is defined.

Closure

A closure is a function that has access to its own scope and the scope of its outer functions.

Hoisting

Hoisting is the behavior of JavaScript where variables and functions are moved to the top of their scope.

TDZ

TDZ (Temporal Dead Zone) is a region in the code where a variable is not accessible.

Scopes, Types of Scope

Scopes determine the accessibility of variables. Types:
* Global scope
* Function scope
* Block scope

Var

var is a keyword used to declare variables.

Let

let is a keyword used to declare block-scoped variables.

Const

const is a keyword used to declare constants.

First Class Function

First-class functions are functions that can be passed as arguments, returned from functions, and assigned to variables.

This Keyword

The this keyword refers to the current execution context.

Function Constructor

The Function constructor is a built-in constructor that creates new functions.

Prototype

A prototype is an object that is shared by all instances of a constructor function.

Prototypal Chaining

Prototypal chaining is the mechanism by which objects inherit properties from their prototypes.

Inheritance

Inheritance is the mechanism by which objects can inherit properties and behavior from other objects.

Scope Chaining

Scope chaining is the mechanism by which variables are resolved in nested scopes.

Function Methods, Types

Function methods are methods that can be called on functions. Types:
* call
* apply
* bind

Function Overloading

Function overloading is not directly supported in JavaScript, but can be achieved using optional parameters or variadic functions.

Ways to Write Array

Arrays can be written using the Array constructor or the array literal syntax.

Recursion

Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself.

Principles of OOPs

OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming) principles include:
* Encapsulation
* Abstraction
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism

Pure and Impure Functions

Pure functions are functions that always return the same output given the same inputs. Impure functions are functions that can return different outputs given the same inputs.

DOM

The DOM (Document Object Model) is a representation of an HTML document as a tree-like structure.

DOM Methods

DOM methods are methods that can be used to manipulate the DOM.

JavaScript Events

JavaScript events are used to respond to user interactions.

Event Handling

Event handling is the process of responding to events.

Event Handler

An event handler is a function that is called in response to an event.
